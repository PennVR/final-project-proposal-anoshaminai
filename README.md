Proposal 1: VR Music Video

In a similar style to the Bohemian Rhapsody music video made by Google or the Squarepusher music video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Olt-ZtV_CE), I would like to make an animated music video in which the viewer is immersed in the world of the video. The music video could also be somewhat interactive, allowing the user to witness different events depending on their location, creating different possible story arcs. For example, at a certain point in the song the user might be able to move to a different location, and therefore be put into a totally different experience.

Proposal 2: Dream-world interactive explorer

Being in explorable VR worlds feels similar to being in a dream-state. I would like to make a game-type interactive explorer where users can choose among several typical dream-scenes (for example: flying, being a mini-person in a house, being chased) and a dream/nightmare toggle. Depending on their selections, the user will be placed in a scene that they are able to explore where their environment is slightly off. The fact that the experience is a dream means that there is no strict storyline required - events can repeat or just be slightly strange. The dream aspect also takes advantage of the differences between the VR experience and reality. As part of the research for this project, it would be interesting to see what typical dream patterns have been identified, so as to offer many people a dream experience that is similar to an actual dream they've had.

Proposal 3: Interactive voice lessons

In a similar style to Guitar Hero and Hive's Audioshield game (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9SFtIdhDG8), this project would allow users to sing along to some pre-selected tracks and would visualize their voices and provide some feedback. Feedback could be as simple as pitch and rhythm issues, but could also potentially be more complicated depending on the tools available. The VR aspect would make for a more interesting and immersive visualization than a simple 2D game experience.
